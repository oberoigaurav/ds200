This work is part of DS 200: Research Methods Course, Department of CDS, IISc.

Dataset for this work is taken from https://data.gov.in/.
Plots are made using matplotlib. 

Line Plot: It shows that there is a gradual increase in GDP and DDP of India over a decade from 2003 to 2015. It also shows that as GDP increased, per capita income of an individual also increased. There is also a sudden increase in economic growth in 2008. 

Scatter Plot: We observe that there is a positive correlation between total length of national highways in our country and the percentage increase in GDP of our country/per capita income of an individual. This is expected from a developing country like India, where the country's development is directly related to infrastructure improvement and income level. Point (68000,22) shows a sudden increase in economic growth in one of the years, whereas infrastructure improvement cannot be sudden. This point belongs to the year 2008 as seen in line plot. 

Box Plot: The box plot shows the variation in length of national highways of different states of our country over the past one decade. It also compares the length between states, however it shows that absolute length of highways cannot be a measure of development of a region. Other factors like geographical area, climatic factors should also be considered. For example UP has higher length because it is mostly plains, whereas Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal covers hilly regions.
